===================
__The framework for rapid software development.__

## support

The support library is a module designed to provide a collection of support class & functions that don't warrant separate
components.

## Compiling

The support library compiles as a stand-alone shared library that you can link against, or you can optionally
statically compile it directly into your application. Once you have all the required dependencies installed it's as simple
as running cmake and installing the resulting build into your system paths. You can then link against the `rapid::support`
library target in your CMakeLists.txt.

__The framework for rapid software development.__

## About

Rapid is a collection of C++ modules that you can use to help build applications. Currently the modules are under heavy
development and and are subject to change without notice.

## network

The network library is a module designed to provide a starting place for managing protocol-based network interfaces in
your applications. It provides default implementations for managing multiple network interfaces, interface
sessions/connections, packet definitions, packet serialization/codec & more. Being built on top of [Wangle](https://github.com/facebook/wangle),
an existing non-blocking I/O (NIO) networking library developed by Facebook, we have a well built async-first backend ready
to power this module & your applications.
